## Roxana Pirvu

I am an overly excited human, I've studies Medical Engineering and worked in healthcare. After realizing that after a while there isn't much left to feel excited about, I started to feel "stuck" and I've decided it's time for a career change and  Makers Academy seemed the perfect place to start. 

I would like the opportunity to continue my learning in a friendly and fun environment.
