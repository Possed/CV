## Who I am
A full-stack developer, fresh Makers graduate, currently looking for a job.
I have always worked in different health-care roles until I realizes that coding would give me the freedom to work in any industry I want doing what I love most: experimenting, building and destroying things.

## Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Hyper Cat](https://github.com/williampowell92/hyper_cat) | Final project | 2 weeks | This application was built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. It was served on an express server and deployed using Travis and Heroku |  Jasmine, Karma and Istanbul |
| [Acebook-Blunicorn](https://github.com/Possed/Acebook-Blunicorn) | This Java/ Spring application was built during the group engineering project week at Makers. The goal was to build a web app that has some of the features and functionality of Facebook. We decided to build this in a stack that was brand new to all of us because we wanted a challenge and we wanted to showcase our ability to learn quickly. | 2 weeks | Java/Springboot, Maven, Webpack, Thymeleaf, React | |
| [Bank tech test](https://github.com/Possed/bank_tech_test) | Aim - testing OO and TDD skills by creating code that is easy to access and interact via IRB. | 1 week | Ruby | RSpec|

## What matters to me
I always put people first - the software I am writing is for people to use so I am trying to make it easy to use, read, change and have good documentation.

I am passionate about problem solving, logical and structured thinking - using logic and reasoning to identify the strenghts and weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions or approaches to problems.

TDD - avoids tedious and time-consuming searching for errors in code; number of bugs is reduced, maintability is enhanced and productivity is incresead - benefits for both programmers and businesses

Feedback - always an oportunity to reflect on how you are doing things and how you can improve.



## Skills

#### Fast learner
Makers helped me discover a new power - quick learning abilities - learn new concenpt and apply them to a range of different problems that serve various purposes.

#### Adaptable
I am not afraid to try new things, experiement and learn from experiences to improve. As a bank staff for NHS I used to work different roles all the time and I enjoyed being part of different teams and learn how they work and how they connect to different other services.

#### Teamwork
I love being part of a team, share my ideas and learn from others.
